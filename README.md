# opendata4osm

opendata4osm is a repository of open data and tools to help use this data to improve OpenStreetMap.

Inspired by [OpenAddresses](https://openaddresses.io/) and [Open Council Data](https://opencouncildata.org/) but with the aim to support any datasets useful for OpenStreetMap and in whichever format or schema is provided.
